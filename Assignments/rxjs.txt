              Characteristics of observables 

Observables provide a unified way to work with different kinds of data. 
That is, observables can emit a single value or a sequence of values, synchronously or asynchronously, lazily (cold) or eagerly (hot), unicast to a single consumer (cold), or multicast to multiple consumer (hot).

           Characteristics of subjects

It allows values to be multicasted to many observers

With subjects you receive the next values in the stream of values from the time of subscription

            Chacteristics of behavioral subjects

BehaviorSubject remembers the last emitted value and gives it to whoever subscribes to it.

With BehaviorSubject you receive the last value as at the time of subscription as well as the next values in the stream
